Reading group resources
-----------------------

This repository contains a bunch of lecture notes and exercises that formed the course materials for a "computer programming reading group" run among a few friends to try to get up to speed with professional computer programming. We decided to focus on web programming, since it forms a major segment of today's job market for career programmers.

The overarching goal of the course was to get the participants some hands-on experience and a solid start to building a portfolio. To this end, we chose a project and covered, in a semistructured way, the knowledge and experience one would need to build it. Our project was just called "dollhouse". Its aim was to provide a web-based "paper dolls" or Colorforms sort of environment where users could create dioramas and populate them with objects.

Learning was "just-in-time" and driven by the project. Foundational/academic knowledge was not emphasized, but studied "opportunistically" when it came up.

We focused on the following tools and technologies:

- Python
- Django
- HTML forms
- Git and Github
- CSS
- JS

These lecture notes are somewhat sketchy, since over time it made more sense to find existing resources online and focus on creating exercises.
